            Owners of vehicles can avoid unforeseen car problems by maintaining
            their vehicles regularly. Early detection of vehicle concerns is
            crucial to preventing them from developing into serious
            difficulties. Owners of vehicles frequently inquire about service at
            auto shops. Vehicle technicians examine crucial parts of the vehicle
            and fix problems to make sure they are in good condition and won't
            break down suddenly.

            Customer records are still entered manually, as are transactions
            with clients, tracking of vehicle repairs as they are made, updates
            on vehicle services, and billing. The functioning of the garage and
            the response time to client inquiries will be slowed by the ongoing
            usage of manual procedures.
